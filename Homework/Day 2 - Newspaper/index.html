          As AI systems become increasingly integrated into workplaces, companies are rapidly adopting automation for tasks ranging from customer service to logistics.

          Experts believe that while some jobs may disappear, new roles in AI monitoring, ethics, and creative collaboration are being born.
          “We’re not facing a job crisis but a transformation,” said Anjali Menon, an AI policy analyst. Educational institutions are also restructuring their courses to include AI-focused curricula from the high school level.
