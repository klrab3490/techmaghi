                In a move underscoring growing US-India counterterrorism
                cooperation, the United States has designated The Resistance
                Front (TRF), a proxy of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), as a Foreign
                Terrorist Organization (FTO). The designation comes in response
                to TRF’s alleged role in the April 22 attack in Pahalgam that
                left 26 civilians dead.
                <br>
                Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the designation on
                Thursday, stating that it aligns with President Donald Trump’s
                demand for accountability in the aftermath of the Pahalgam
                attack.

                “This action against the TRF demonstrates the Trump

                Rubio added that the TRF, along with other aliases, has been
                added to LeT’s designation as both an FTO and a Specially
                Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Section 219 of the
                Immigration and Nationality Act and Executive Order 13224.

                Reacting to the news, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar

                cooperation.”
                <br>
                “Another demonstration of strong India-USA counter-terrorism

                Organization and Specially Designated Global Terrorist. TRF is a
